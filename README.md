### Hi there 👋

I am a second-year computer science student at Poznan University of Technology 📚. 
I develop web applications in React, Typescript and Next.js 🖱. Besides that, I also have experience working with the REST API and
MERN stack. In addition, I am familiar with Python 🐍, which mainly serves me as a tool for
learning algorithms and data structures, and I am a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner ☁. My
experience comes from self-learning along with internship 💻. Besides that, I am passionate
about crypto ⛓ and cloud concepts ☁. I believe we can learn anything with enough time and selfdiscipline 👨‍🏫. 
I am committed to learning new technologies and further developing my skills as a web developer 📈.
